Sure, here's a proposed `README.md` file for your program:

---

# Character Sequences Finder

This program is a C application that takes a 5x5 grid of characters as input and finds the longest sequence of the same character in the grid. Sequences can be in rows, columns, or diagonals.

## Compilation

To compile the program, you can use a C compiler such as gcc. Here is an example of how to compile this program:

```bash
gcc -o seq_finder seq_finder.c
```

Replace `seq_finder.c` with the actual filename of your C source code file.

## Usage

Run the program using the command line. The program will wait for your input. Input a 5x5 grid of characters. After you've inputted all characters, press enter to submit your input and the program will display the result.

Here is an example of how to run the program and an example input:

```bash
./seq_finder
a b c d e
f g h i j
k l m n o
p q r s t
u v w x y
```

The program will output the character that has the longest sequence and the length of that sequence.

For instance, for the given example, the output might be:

```bash
a 1
```

## Output

The output of the program is a character and a number. The character is the one that has the longest sequence in the grid. The number is the length of that sequence. If there are several sequences with the same maximum length, the program will output one of them.

Please replace `seq_finder` with the actual name of your program. If your program behaves differently, you should adjust the `README.md` file accordingly. 

Remember, a good `README.md` should provide clear instructions on how to compile and use your program, and also explain what the program does and what its output means.
